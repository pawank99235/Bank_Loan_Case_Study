# Bank_Loan_Case_Study

In this project, we’re working as a Data Analyst in a finance 
company that specializes in lending various types of loans to 
urban customers. Our company faces challenge some 
customers who don’t have a sufficient credit history take 
advantage of this and default their loans. Our task to do EDA 
to analyze the patterns in the data and ensure that capable 
applicants are not rejected.
When a customer applies for a loan, your company faces 
two risks:
1. If the applicant can repay the loan but is not approved, 
the company loses business.
2. If the applicant cannot repay the loan and is approved, 
the company faces a financial loss.
We’re working with the dataset contains information about 
loan applications. It include two types of scenarios.
1. Customers with payment difficulties: These are 
customers who had a late payment of more than X days 
on at least one of the first Y installments of the loan.
2. All other cases: These are cases where the payment was 
made on time.
When a customer applies for a loan, there are four possible 
outcomes:
1. Approved: The company has approved the loan 
application.
2. Cancelled: The customer cancelled the application 
during the approval process.
3. Refused: The company rejected the loan.
4. Unused Offer: The loan was approved but the customer 
did not use it
